  description = {After a long initial chapter on a general history of algorithms, each following chapter presents a paradigm and its application to music composition. The paradigms covered are: Markov models (MM), grammars, Petri nets, chaotic and Lindenmayer systems (LS), genetic algorithms, cellular automata, neural networks, machine learning and other AI techniques. I only read the chapters on MM, chaos and LS. The level of explanation varies a lot: LS were well explained, chaotic systems not at all and MM somewhere in the middle. The application to composition is also not easy to follow at places, as the author tries to cover several complex approaches in a few pages. The synopsis at the end of each chapter provides a good high-level summary, often introducing the links between approaches and paradigms that make things click in your head. To sum up, not the easiest of books, but certainly covers a wealth of material for further exploration.},
